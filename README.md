### Hi there 👋

## WARNING<br>
This README.md was created rapidly with a low inspiration of the moment.<br>
Trust me, i will do a better one when back from <strong>Summer vacation!</strong>

## What's upcoming?
I’m currently working on Breezy CSS, a <code>C</code>lassless <code>S</code>emantic <code>S</code>tylesheet that is a breeze to use. 🍿🍿🍿

The repo is currently private and will be turned to public soon (expected by the end of September 2023).

<em>Stay tuned & all the best for now!
